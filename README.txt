Bassel, 22/ 3

- added forest theme sound effects
- fixed bugs with background sounds and theme music
- modified setTheme function to load each theme's sound effects
- blocked the user from pressing return during Getplayername (bad stuff happens)
- fixed a bug where if a pad dissapeared and the user returns
to the main menu and plays again the pad will remain dissapeared
- same thing with slow, the pad's rect fill color will remain red
